This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that utilize various datasets for different machine learning tasks. The datasets used in these notebooks are sourced from Kaggle and are available for download at the following links:

- **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: This dataset is used for detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card data. You can download it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection).

- **Customer Churn Prediction**: This dataset is used for predicting customer churn in a banking context. It helps in understanding which customers are likely to leave the bank and can be used to develop strategies to retain them. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction).

- **SMS Spam Detection**: This dataset is used for detecting spam messages in a collection of SMS messages. It's a valuable resource for developing models that can filter out unwanted messages. You can download it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).
